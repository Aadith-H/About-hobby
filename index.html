<p>
    My favorite Hobby is Building stuff. I like it because it is fun and it teaches me about engineering skills.
    I love building things! 
    <br>
    From making paper airplanes that can actually fly to constructing miniature bridges with straws and glue,
     engineering lets me turn everyday stuff into awesome inventions.
     <br>
There are so many different types of engineering. There's the kind that builds skyscrapers and
 bridges, making cities look like futuristic playgrounds. 
 <br>Then there's the one that sends rockets to space, exploring the great unknown.
  I even heard about bioengineers who work with living things to make the world a better place. It's like being a part of a club where each member has a unique skill set.
  <br>
     I also like coding. It ties to engineering and I can program things that I make.
    Engineering and coding are like having a superpower. You get to create things that others might think are impossible. 
    <br>
    The coolest part is that coding is like a secret language that lets people like me almost talk to computers. It's not as hard as it sounds! I started with simple stuff, 
    like making my computer say "Hello, World!" but now I can make games, websites, and even control gadgets with just a few clicks and clacks on the keyboard.
